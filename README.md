I tried to make a crowdfunding web app powered by POLYGON MUMBAI TESTNET.

The contract address is 0xAC0013A90Da90Bc514fEFb0015f7fd1baC9EDe21

Contract Link - https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xac0013a90da90bc514fefb0015f7fd1bac9ede21

All the data is stored in the polygon testnet blockchain. The web app is getting all the data from the network itself.
